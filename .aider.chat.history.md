Commenting and discussion threads inside the document.

Creative rooms for brainstorming.

Shared library of public or private writing projects.

Voting system for ideas, chapters, or plot branches.

5. Community & Social Features

Public collaborative projects.

Writing clubs or thematic groups.

6. Technical Requirements

Cloud synchronization for multi-user editing.

Stable backend with conflict resolution algorithms.

Frontend with smooth text-rendering engine.

Cross-platform support (web, iOS, Android).

Strong encryption & privacy protection.

7. Smart Features

AI auto-continuation suggestions.

Tone/style transformation tools.

Collaboration analytics (activity heatmaps, contribution charts).

8. UI/UX Style

Minimalistic, elegant writing environment.

Distraction-free mode.

Dark mode & custom themes.

9. Monetization

Premium features (AI tools, unlimited projects, extra storage).

Paid writing clubs.

Marketplace for selling co-written works.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will most likely need to be edited to satisfy your request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate the new app logo.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

> mini-app/lib/metadata.ts  
> Add file to the chat? (Y)es/(N)o/(D)on't ask again [Yes]: y  

I will update the app metadata and create the logo generation file.

Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I will provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
